WTKO Summer Camp 2025 - England, Norwich



After a successful trip to the Summer Camp in Portugal in July, where our group’s commitment to their karate and the camaraderie was recognised by all of the senior instructors, we have been given the honour of hosting next year’s summer camp.

This is an amazing opportunity, and underpins our ethos of team spirit and dedication to karate whilst giving the world the chance to visit our fine city

Here’s to 2025.
